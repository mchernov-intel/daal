<p>Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for non-Intel microprocessors
for optimizations that are not unique to Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2,
SSE3, and SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not guarantee the availability,
functionality, or effectiveness of any optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel.
Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended for use with Intel microprocessors.
Certain optimizations not specific to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel microprocessors.
