Multi-class Classifier
======================

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 4

While some classification algorithms naturally permit the use of more
than two classes, some algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM), are by nature solving a two-class problem only. These
two-class (or binary) classifiers can be turned into multi-class
classifiers by using different strategies, such as One-Against-Rest
or One-Against-One.

|product| implements a Multi-Class Classifier using the
One-Against-One strategy.

Multi-class classifiers, such as SVM, are based on two-class
classifiers, which are integral components of the models trained with
the corresponding multi-class classifier algorithms.


Details
*******

Given :math:`n` feature vectors :math:`x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})`
of size :math:`p`, the number of classes :math:`K`, and a vector of class labels
:math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`, where :math:`y_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, K-1\}`,
the problem is to build a multi-class classifier using a two-class
(binary) classifier, such as a two-class SVM.

Training Stage
--------------

The model is trained with the One-Against-One method that uses the
binary classification described in
[Hsu02]_ as follows:
For each pair of classes :math:`(i, j)`, train a binary classifier, such
as SVM. The total number of such binary classifiers is :math:`K(K-1)/2`.

Prediction Stage
----------------

Given a new feature vector :math:`x_i`, the classifier determines
the class to which the vector belongs.

|product| provides two methods for class label prediction:

-  Wu method. According to the algorithm 2 for computation of the
   class probabilities described in [Wu04]_.
   The library returns the index of the class with the largest
   probability.
-  Vote-based method. If the binary classifier predicts the
   feature vector to be in :math:`i`-th class, the number of votes for the
   class i is increased by one, otherwise the vote is given to the
   j-th class. If two classes have equal numbers of votes, the
   class with the smallest index is selected.

Batch Processing
****************

Multi-class classifier follows the general workflow described in
`Usage Model: Training and Prediction <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-usage-model-training-and-prediction-1>`_.

Training
