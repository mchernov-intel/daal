+=======================================================================+
| Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for      |
| non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to    |
| Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and    |
| SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not        |
| guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any    |
| optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel.            |
| Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended   |
| for use with Intel microprocessors. Certain optimizations not         |
| specific to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel            |
| microprocessors. Please refer to the applicable product User and      |
| Reference Guides for more information regarding the specific          |
| instruction sets covered by this notice.                              |
|                                                                       |
