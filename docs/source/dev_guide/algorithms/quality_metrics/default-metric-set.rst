Working with the Default Metric Set
===================================

For your convenience, |short_name| provides a set of quality metrics for some algorithms.

At this moment, documentation for quality metrics is only available in Developer Guide for Intel(R) DAAL:

`Quality Metrics for Binary Classification Algorithms <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-quality-metrics-for-binary-classification-algorithms>`_
`Quality Metrics for Multi-class Classification Algorithms <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-quality-metrics-for-multi-class-classification-algorithms>`_
`Quality Metrics for Linear Regression <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-quality-metrics-for-linear-regression>`_
`Quality Metrics for Principal Components Analysis <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-quality-metrics-for-principal-components-analysis>`_
