LogitBoost Classifier
=====================

LogitBoost is a boosting classification algorithm.
LogitBoost and AdaBoost are close to each other in the sense that both perform an additive logistic regression.
The difference is that AdaBoost minimizes the exponential loss, whereas LogitBoost minimizes the logistic loss.

LogitBoost within |short_name| implements a multi-class classifier.
