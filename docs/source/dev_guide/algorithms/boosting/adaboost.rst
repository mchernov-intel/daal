AdaBoost Classifier
===================

AdaBoost (short for "Adaptive Boosting") is a popular boosting classification algorithm.
AdaBoost algorithm performs well on a variety of data sets except some noisy data [Freund99]_.

AdaBoost is a binary classifier.
For a multi-class case, use :ref:`svm_multi_class` framework of the library.
