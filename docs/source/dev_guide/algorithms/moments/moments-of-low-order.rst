Moments of Low Order
====================

Moments are basic quantitative measures of data set characteristics such as location and dispersion.
|short_name| computes the following low order characteristics: 

- minimums/maximums
- sums
- means
- sums of squares
- sums of squared differences from the means
- second order raw moments
- variances
- standard deviations
- variations

At this moment, the full documentation for Moments of Low Order is only available in
`Developer Guide for Intel(R) DAAL <https://software.intel.com/en-us/daal-programming-guide-moments-of-low-order>`_.
